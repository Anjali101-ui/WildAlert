### Project Description
WildGuard is a real-time wildlife monitoring system that detects animals using AI, calculates risk levels, and provides alerts to forest officers. It helps prevent human-animal conflicts and ensures safer forest management.

### The Problem Statement
Forest officers cannot constantly monitor wildlife movement, leading to accidents and conflicts. Existing systems are either offline or manually intensive.

### The Solution
WildGuard uses live video feeds, AI-based animal detection (YOLOv8), risk assessment, and a user-friendly dashboard to provide real-time alerts, location tracking, and a risk panel for informed decision-making.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

**Software:**
* Languages: Python 3
* Frameworks: Streamlit
* Libraries: OpenCV, YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), Pandas, SQLite, Folium/Leaflet.js
* Tools: VS Code, Git

**Hardware:**
* Camera: Webcam or IP Camera
* Laptop/PC with Python 3.9+
* Internet connection for map tiles


## Features

* Real-time animal detection via live video feed  
* Dashboard showing animal type, speed, direction, ETA, and risk level  
* Map visualization using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap  
* Optional database logging for detection events
